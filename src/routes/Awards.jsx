            The Category Second Place Awards recognize the teams with the second highest overall
            scores in each of the six competition categories, with this category representing
            Student Researched and Developed (SRAD) Hybrid/Liquid engines targeting an apogee of
            30000 feet, moving us a division up from last year. Teams are scored on the project
            technical report, competency of design, quality of construction, degree of student
            development, flight performance, and operating procedures. Our team received this
            award for finishing second in our category at the 2019 IREC, with the debut flight
            of SOTS.

            The Jim Furfaro Award for Technical Excellence recognizes a team which demonstrates
            exceptional engineering discipline and technical skill through their analyses and
            conclusions, project or program planning and execution, operational procedure,
            manufacturing processes, iterative improvement, systems engineering methodology, and
            robust design. Our team was presented with this award after our successful launch and
            recovery of Vidar III at the 2017 IREC, based on our iterative design on the Vidar
            system over the previous four years.

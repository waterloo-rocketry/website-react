          <Content title="WHY JOIN US?">
            There are many benefits to joining a student design team. Learn
            invaluable engineering skills, meet likeminded and talented people,
            gain experience to put on a resume, and have fun. Join us, and you
            can even call yourself a rocket scientist. Our team is open to all,
            with no prior experience needed. At Waterloo Rocketry, we design,
            build, test, and launch rockets to altitudes of 30,000 feet. As a
            member of our team, you will have opportunities to make meaningful
            contributions to our projects, irrespective of your current experience
            level.

          <FAQComponent questionText="Who can join the team? What requirements or prerequisites are there? How do I apply?" index={0}>
            <div>
              The only requirement to join the team is to be a student at the University of
              Waterloo. No prior experience is required, and there is no application process. The
              team is open and welcome to everyone, not just engineering students.

          <FAQComponent questionText="What time commitment is required of team members?" index={1}>
            <div>
              There is no &quot;time commitment&quot; that a team member needs to meet. Of course,
              if you take on work for a project,
              then it is expected that you communicate with the subteam to ensure it is finished in
              a reasonable time period.
              In terms of &quot;hours per week&quot; etc, however, you can put as much or as little
              in as you wish.

          </FAQComponent>

          <FAQComponent questionText="What do the team's day to day operations look like?" index={2}>
            <div>
              The team is split up into different subteams - for example - electrical, recovery,
              propulsion, etc. Each subteam has regular meetings, usually once a week, while the
              entire team gathers for a weekly general meeting.
              Each subteam is responsible for a different part of the rocket and supporting
              equipment.
              A subteam lead supervises the operation of each subteam. You are not restricted to
              any one subteam; you can be a part of as many as you want. Communication is done
              primarily through a Slack workspace.

            <div>
              Sure! We don&apos;t mind if you&apos;re on another design team, but there&apos;s no
              guarantee our meeting times won&apos;t overlap.

              There is usually a variety of ongoing tasks to choose from. Some examples of past

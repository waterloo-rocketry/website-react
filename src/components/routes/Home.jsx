              Waterloo Rocketry is a student design team from the University of Waterloo in
              Waterloo, Ontario. We currently have around 50 members, primarily
              undergraduate students in engineering, science, and mathematics. We design,
              build, and launch rockets to a target altitude of 30,000&apos; at the
              Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition each June at Spaceport America,
              New Mexico. Our team&apos;s primary objective is to provide students
              with hands-on learning opportunities in research, design, analysis, fabrication, and
              testing throughout the entire engineering design cycle.
